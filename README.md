# ssdFFTISRU

Modified The Golden Standard for FFT.

Two version:
1. Water->Deut & ore ->He3 (requires stock mining extension or other mod that mines Water, ore->deut cfg also provided)
2. mine deut directly (He3 not added as FFT added resource def themselves)

By default first version is enabled! If you want to mine deut directly, please rename the .cfgx files inside FFTMining folder to .cfg

Untested, please post issues at issues tab lol
